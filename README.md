# InOut-TGB
This project was created for the first edition of InOut, hackathon organized by NIT Surat. Here, we have built a website that connects travelmates going on to the same place.
Suppose you or your group are going to Goa and some guy/group is also going to Goa, then this web app helps you connect the other group so that you can plan your trip together.
The people are suggested based on the interests you have given in your profile. Hence you can always be sure to meet like minded people on your trip.
